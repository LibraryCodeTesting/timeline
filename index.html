        <p>Monmouth County Library is established by the County Board of Freeholders, after a majority of residents vote in favor of starting a county library system. The <i>County Board of Agriculture</i>, the <i>Grange</i>, and the County Agent all strongly support opening a library as well.</p>
        <p>The <i>Monmouth County Library Commission</i> appoints Elinor E. Randall as the first County Librarian. Randall’s job begins on May 1st.</p>
        <p>The library is expected to be fully functioning on September 1st.</p>

        <p>Station libraries are being established by the County Library Commission.</p>
        <p>The goal for the station libraries is to make books more easily available to county residents than a city library system could. They are a mix of public and private locations that will house circulating collections for registered borrowers to use.</p>
        <p>The first stations are established at Holmdel, Rumson, and at the Woman’s Club in Ocean Grove.</p>
        <p>Every other month, the stations will be visited by the Monmouth County Library's <i>book automobile</i> to will receive a changing variety books to circulate among the patrons.</p>
        <p>The library's automobile can hold 800 books, phonograph records, and pictures. It was made from a refurbished truck and weighs more than one ton.</p>
        <p>Outside of library stations, residents will also be able to borrow items by mailing item requests to the Librarian’s Office at the Courthouse in Freehold.</p>

        <p>After more than 1 year in service, Bertram says that the library has, “completely outgrown its quarters in the basement of the courthouse.”</p>

        <p>There are now 23,875 books in Monmouth County Library's collection, and they are available to patrons through 40 library stations.</p>
        <p>A professional relationship with local schools has also started: Monmouth County Library now delivers items requested by teachers and students directly to schools. This allows teachers and students to order reference materials to supplment their lessons, or simply order items to enjoy on their free time.</p>
        <p>A survey wassent to every school in the county, which lead to responses from 41 schools. The library then visited 26 schools, out of which 11 were then selected to help house circulating children’s collections.</p>

        <p>The headquarters for Monmouth County Library has expanded into a remodeled boiler room behind the Courthouse in Freehold. There are now 36,557 books in the collection - which is a 53% increase over 14 months. 3,738 of the books were delivered to fulfill patron book requests.</p>
        <p>Books can be borrowed for as long as patrons need to finish them. The time could be extended if the books were used for studies, or if someone lived far from a library station.</p>
          <p>There are 11,170 registered patrons, many of which report that they borrow items for their family members and neighbors as well as for themselves. County librarians also say that metal workers, plumbers, carpenters, and other manual laborers often ask for materials that help with learning more skills and techniques for their trades.</p>
        <p>At this time, the library is supported by a tax of 0.2 mill, which comes from the towns who voted to join into the county library system. The tax provides $20,770 to the library for work functions, and another $1,280 is provided by the state to help the library's <i>book automobile</i> to deliver requested materials to 50 schools.</p>
        <p>116 stations now exist, and the <i>book automobile</i> visits each one every 2 months. The largest stations are located in Allentown, Atlantic Highlands, Brielle, Farmingdale, Keansburg, Ocean Grove, and Red Bank.</p>
        <p>The library states that its goal for 1927 will be to increase demand for the library stations.</p>

        <p>Monmouth County Library continues to grow quickly.</p>
        <p>The headquarters location in Freehold is reporting that its space is becoming too crowded again.</p> 
        <p>The books have made 41,268 circulations in the past year – which was an increase of 10,000 more book circulations compared to the year prior.</p>
        <p>To keep up with the increased demand, the number of library staff has grown. However, some locations - such as the Keansburg location - are still reporting that can no longer rely on volunteer help to stay open for their set schedules, and must now implement paid staffing.</p>
        <p>It is also reported that the books housed at each location are tailored to fit each community’s individual preferences and needs – which are relayed to Monmouth County Library by the people who are overseeing the library stations.</p>

        <p>The following marketing tactics are being used to acquaint people with the Library’s services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A librarian joined the grange to have direct contact with farmers and learn their needs.</li>
                <li>Lectures have been given about Monmouth County Library's services within meetings at the Grange, the Young Men’s Christian Association, Women’s Clubs, at schools, and other organizations.</li>
                <li>Local newspapers publish articles about the Library, and advertise new or specialized books to the public.</li>
                <li>The book automobile was designed to make it easily recognizable.</li>
                <li>Library exhibits have been made especially for farmers - which included books on agriculture, books for women and children who live on farms, a map showing the locations of library station, useful charts, and more.</li>
                <li>“Effective use is made of the library camera.”</li>
                <li>Cooperation is maintained with the County Health Office, various Parent-Teacher Associations, the Boy Scouts of America, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the County Board of Agriculture, the County Social Service Organization, School Boards, Women’s Clubs, Mission-Study Classes, the Grange, the Farm Bureau, Churches, and Schools.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Librarians also give the following examples of patron needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A farmer requested a trade book that wasn’t in the library.Monmouty County Library then requested to borrow that book from 6 other libraries, the State Library, and from the Publisher directly - though without success. Finally, the Secretary of the State Library Commission was able to borrow a private copy from someone they knew to help the farmer.</li>
                <li>A farm boy with little chance for schooling borrowed a book on stationary engineering. After studying it all winter, they passed an exam to become a stationary engineer and secured a good position of employment.</li>
                <li>A sheep herder borrowed a book on animal diseases when his sheep became sick. With the book, he was able to save his herd, while other flocks perished.</li>
                <li>When the local potato crop failed and diversification became necessary, Monmouth County Library was ready to help local farmers research their options by having books on truck-gardens, fruit farming, dairy production, and poultry management.</li>

        <p>The custodians of the Monmouth County Library system meet in Red Bank Library to form the <i>Monmouth County Library Round Table</i>. Henry S. White - President of Red Bank Public Library - is voted to be the Board President, and meetings will occur in the spring and fall. The next meeting will be in May at the home of Mrs. B. D. Yard in Allentown.</p>
        <p>At this meeting, every participant reported increased circulation numbers, partly due the Great Depression, which has lead to an increase in the number of people who are now unemployed and are taking advantage of their free time.</p>
        <p>The largest problem among the libraries now is the lack of new books due dwindling funds. The library’s funding, which usually comes from taxes, is now unavailable due to so many being unemployed and living in financial strain. Round Table participants are asked to let the public know of the situation.</p>
